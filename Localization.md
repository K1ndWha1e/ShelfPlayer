# Localization Instructions for ShelfPlayer

To add a new translation for ShelfPlayer, please follow these detailed instructions:

## Step 1: Open an Issue

Before starting any localization work, open an issue on the project’s repository detailing which language you are planning to translate into. This ensures that the necessary configuration can be prepared by the maintainers.

## Step 2: Files to Localize

Once the configuration is in place, localize the following files using Xcode:

- `Multiplatform/InfoPlist.xcstrings`
- `Multiplatform/Localizable.xcstrings`
- `Multiplatform/AppIntentVocabulary.plist`
- `WidgetsExtension/Localizable.xcstrings`
- `ShelfPlayerKit/AppShortcuts.xcstrings`
- `ShelfPlayerKit/Localizable.xcstrings`

**Note:** The project does not need to run or build in order to translate these files.

## Step 3: Submit Your Work

After localizing the files, submit your work via a pull request. Ensure that your changes are comprehensive and consistent with the style of the rest of the project.

## Step 4: Maintain Updates

If you do not respond to future requests for updates or corrections, your localization might be removed or handled using AI-generated translations. This is necessary to ensure that users have accurate and up-to-date translations, rather than seeing placeholder text.

By following these instructions, you can contribute effectively to the ShelfPlayer project and help make it accessible to a wider audience. If you have any questions during the process, feel free to reach out through the repository’s communication channels.

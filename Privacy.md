The following data may be collected by your operating system (Apple iOS):

- App performance metrics (if developer data sharing is enabled)  
- Crash reports (if crash reporting is enabled)

The app may store the following information that you provide or generate through usage:

- Audiobookshelf server URL and login credentials  
- Downloaded content  
- Cached content  
- App preferences and settings  
- Playback information (progress, bookmarks, etc.)

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information described above solely to:

- Provide access to and play content from your library  
- Store your app preferences and playback progress  
- Improve app performance and stability  
- Enable offline playback by downloading items

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- All data is stored locally on your device  
- iCloud is used for backup only if enabled by you

ShelfPlayer integrates with the following services:

- Your personal Audiobookshelf server  
- Apple services such as App Store Connect (for crash reporting and performance metrics) via the operating system
- iOS system features including Siri, the Journal app, Shortcuts, and iCloud sync

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Data collected by Apple through these services (e.g., crash reports, performance metrics) is governed by [Apple’s Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/), not by ShelfPlayer.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices  
You can manage your data and privacy in the following ways:

## 6. Data Retention  
We do not retain any personal data on external servers. All information is stored locally on your device and remains there until you choose to delete it. Backup and secure storage via iCloud and the device keychain may be relevant to your data’s safety and privacy.
